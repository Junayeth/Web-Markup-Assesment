            <h2>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h2>
            <section>
                <article class="p1">
                    <h3>The Beggining</h3>
                    <img src="img/begining.jpg" class="img" alt="Begining Jiu Jitsu">
                    <p>
                            The Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) story begins in Japan, where an early form of Jiu-Jitsu (also called Ju-Jitsu) was developed for use on the field of battle by Japanese samurai. 
							These warriors, who engaged in armed battles on horseback, developed Jiu-Jitsu as the last line of defense in the event that they found themselves disarmed and afoot. 
							However, the heavy armor worn by the samurai restricted their mobility, making chokes, joint locks, and throws preferable to striking techniques. 
							Over time, Japanese Jiu-Jitsu branched off into a number of different styles, with the focus gradually shifting from armed combat to general self-defense. 
							And while each style differed in certain aspects, the focus on throws, strangles, and joint locks remained a constant theme. 
							One man’s style, however, with its emphasis on maximum efficiency and minimal effort, would eventually rise above the rest.

                    <p>
                            The art of BJJ continued to evolve over the years, eventually incorporating aspects of wrestling and other grappling arts into the curriculum. 
							However, BJJ would remain relatively unknown outside of Brazil until Hélio’s son, Rorion, immigrated to the United States to spread the art of 
							BJJ—a move that would forever change the way the world viewed the art of fighting.

                <p>
                        At every level there is a fighting (or better: defensive) sport to practice. You can learn techniques but you are also challenged conditionally. 
						Respect and togetherness are always at the top and disciplined teachers help you reach your goal.
                        The more balanced the challenge, the more fun it is to continue! You can flow in whenever you want, at any level!
